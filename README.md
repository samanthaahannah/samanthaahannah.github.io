# Hannah Graphics

NOTE: My website is currently being redesigned and rewritten to match some new business cards I made, and to be more semantic.
Feel free to visit http://hannahgraphics/index_copy.html for my new design, though, it is just a work in progress for now.

Welcome to Hannah Graphics; a website dedicated to my business and showcasing my work in motion graphics, 3D animation, game design, and graphics design.

I will also post my current interests and projects including Augmented and virtual reality.

Thank you for visiting and stay tuned for more content in the near future.
